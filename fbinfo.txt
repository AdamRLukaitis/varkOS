Buffer format
u32 Buffer size including padding
u32 Request/Response indicator
    0x00000000 - Request
    0x80000000 - Response
    0c80000001 - Response error
u8...: Concatenated tags
u32: 0x00000000 End tag
u8...: padding

Tag format
u32: Tag
u32: Value buffer length
u32: Request indicator (0x00000000) + value buffer length
     This gets over written with 0x80000000 + value buffer length, in the response
u8...: Value buffer
       The value buffer must include space for the response values, in the request. For example, it the request is only 4 bytes, 
       but the expected response is 8 bytes, the the tag will look as follows:
		u32: 0x________ Tag value
		u32: 0x00000004 Value buffer length of the request
		u32: 0x00000008 Request indicator + value buffer length of the request
		u32: 0x________ Request value, will be over written in the response, with the first 4 bytes of the response value
		u32: 0x00000000 Placeholder for the second 4 bytes of response

For the framebuffer all the set tags with an allocate buffer request, must be sent in one go. Sending set requests separately, will not work.
